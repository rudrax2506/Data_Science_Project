🔍 JSON Data Cleaning and Recommendation System in Python

📌 Project Overview
This is a data science mini-project focused on performing data cleaning and building a simple recommendation system using only Python and a JSON dataset. The project demonstrates how to process and clean nested JSON data, remove duplicates, filter out incomplete records, and implement basic friend and page suggestions — entirely without external libraries.

🧠 Key Objectives:
Load and parse JSON data.
Clean the dataset by:
  Removing users with no friends.
  Removing duplicate entries (like duplicate page IDs or user names).
  Handling missing or empty fields (like blank names).
Implement functionality to:
  Suggest "People You May Know" for a given user.
  Recommend "Pages You May Like" for a given user.

📁 Dataset Sample
The 2 json files h=which have been used for the project have also been included. They are data.json and data2.json

 Features
✅ Clean malformed or duplicate entries
✅ Remove users with no friends
✅ Suggest potential friends based on mutual connections
✅ Recommend pages based on mutual interests

🚧 Project Status
Currently In Progress
I'm just getting started with this project and will update the repository with each feature I implement. Stay tuned for commits, code improvements, and possible visualizations!
